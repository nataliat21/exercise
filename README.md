# Exercise
In this project, you can clearly see the use of the classes provided by the Bootstrap library. These classes were used to design a flexible layout consisting of three columns. This layout adapts dynamically depending on the device used, whether it is a mobile or desktop device.

Using Bootstrap classes allows columns to be optimally distributed across different screen sizes, providing a consistent and enjoyable user experience across devices. By using these classes, you achieve a flexible and responsive structure that automatically adjusts to provide the best visualization and functionality in each situation.
